### Windows: Visual Studio

- After extracting the zip, the parent folder `raylib-game-template` should exist in the same directory as `raylib` itself.  So, your file structure should look like this:
    - Some parent directory
        - `raylib`
            - the contents of https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
        - `raylib-game-template`
            - this `README.md` and all other raylib-game-template files
- If using Visual Studio, open projects/VS2022/raylib-game-template.sln
- Select on `raylib_game` in the solution explorer, then in the toolbar at the top, click `Project` > `Set as Startup Project`
- Now you're all set up!  Click `Local Windows Debugger` with the green play arrow and the project will run.
